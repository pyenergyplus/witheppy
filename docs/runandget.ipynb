    "The primary motivation is to develop functions that can be used for distributed simulation. EnergyPlus generates a large volume of result files. You may be interested in only some data in these results, maybe even just one number - like the total energy use. In distributed simulation, some of your simulation nodes may be scattered over the internet and transfer of large files can be expensive and time consuming. So it would be useful to have a function in eppy that would run the simulation and return some specific results. the rest of the result files may be in a temporary location will be deleted.\n",
