idf.copyidfobject has a documentaiton error in the func. docs.
wold be good to have idf.copyidfobject(origobject, Name="Something") like DUp and edit in IDFEditor

figure this out:

- in testing, the idd should be loaded only once
- It should be possible to load a different IDD when needed
- work with fixtures and scope to do this ?
- looks like this should be done in eppy with a logger in the pytest

pip install https://github.com/santoshphilip/eppy/archive/master.zip



list of TODOs that come up while coding.

- continuous testing should install Energyplus to idf.run()
- looks like idf.run() may be changing idf.idfname ot in.idf
- is the tests in runner changing the idf.iddname when it runs

- finished eplaunch_run(idf) with continious testing on linux
